# jtsm 

This is a basic web app framework for PHP 5.4.  
It is currently in a very rudimentary state.

## Advantages

 - Works on PHP 5.4 - you don't need the latest!
 - Does not require any URL rewriting - can work with nginx on a server
   you don't control
 - Stores all configuration information in .php files - can work on servers
   that do not block access to specific files or directories, or that do not
   provide space outside the document root for storage.
